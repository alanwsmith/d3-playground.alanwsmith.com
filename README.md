This is the source code for the site

## Notes

The main pages for the site are under
indivudal files in the pages directory like:

`pages/sunburst-sequences/index.js`

The components are stored in the `components`
directory like:

`components/SunburstSequences.js`

The names match with the exception of the
case and spacing.

The other files involved are the examples of how
to call the components. Those are stored in the
root of the `pages` directory with a matching
name prepended with: `example-page`, like:

`/pages/example-page-sunburst-sequences.js`

Those files are included in the main pages as
code snippets but viewing them lets you verify
everything is working.
